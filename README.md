# Coding-Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

You are able to start this project with this command

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TechStack and Packages

- create-react-app
- react
- redux
- react-bootstrap
- thunk
- axios

## Features

- Community name
- Image for the community
- Average price of all the homes associated with that community
- responsive layout
- invalid data handling(image not found, communities without homes)

## If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? Would you implement anything differently?

- Add a page for every single community
- Sorting and filtering function of communities
- Spend more time learning TypeScript. To be honest, it is my second time to use Typescript. I believe if I can spend more time with TypeScript, my code can be cleaner.

## Footnote

I am glad I can take this coding test. Typescript is really interesting and it becomes more popular. I really like it.
Thank you.
